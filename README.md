# Selenium Testing for Job Portal

This repository contains Selenium-based automated test scripts designed for testing a job portal web application. The tests cover various functionalities and features of the job portal, such as user registration, job searching, applying for jobs, and more. These tests aim to ensure the web application behaves as expected, providing a reliable experience for users.

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how Selenium WebDriver can be used for automated testing of a job portal web application. This includes functional tests for user interaction, form submissions, and validation of essential features. These tests are essential to ensure that the web portal provides a smooth and error-free experience for users.

### Key Functionalities Tested:
- User registration and login
- Job searching and filtering
- Viewing job details
- Applying for jobs
- User profile updates
- Logout functionality

## Test Scenarios

The following test cases are implemented using Selenium WebDriver for the job portal:

1. **User Registration**
   - Test user registration with valid and invalid data.
   - Test duplicate email and username handling.
   
2. **User Login**
   - Test login functionality with valid and invalid credentials.
   - Test password reset process.
   
3. **Job Search**
   - Test searching for jobs by keywords and location.
   - Test filtering jobs by categories, types, and experience levels.
   
4. **Job Details**
   - Test viewing details of a specific job posting.
   - Verify job description, salary, and company information are displayed correctly.

5. **Job Application**
   - Test applying for a job as a logged-in user.
   - Verify the application confirmation message.
   
6. **User Profile Management**
   - Test updating user profile information (e.g., name, contact details, resume upload).
   
7. **Logout**
   - Test logging out of the portal.
   
## Course Key Topics

This repository is built based on the core principles of **Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and Testing**, which are crucial in ensuring the reliability of software systems like the job portal. Key topics from the course are applied throughout this repository:

### 1. **Software Quality Assurance and Testing Fundamentals**
   - Understanding the importance of software quality and testing in the development lifecycle.
   - **Manual vs Automated Testing**: Benefits of automated testing in reducing time and ensuring consistency.
   - **Test Planning and Documentation**: Creating effective test plans, test cases, and managing testing schedules.

### 2. **Testing Methodologies**
   - **Black-box Testing**: Focusing on functional aspects and user interactions of the job portal, ensuring it meets specifications.
   - **White-box Testing**: For deeper system functionality, testing APIs, and backend services.
   - **Regression Testing**: Ensuring that new code changes do not break existing functionalities, especially in the job search and application process.
   - **Smoke Testing**: Verifying the most critical features (e.g., user login, job application) work after deployment.

### 3. **Types of Testing Covered**
   - **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions (e.g., validating individual fields in the registration form).
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensuring that components like the database and server interact correctly with the job portal frontend.
   - **System Testing**: Comprehensive testing of the entire job portal to ensure it meets business requirements.
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Ensuring the job portal meets the expectations of the end-user.

### 4. **Automation and Tools**
   - **Selenium WebDriver**: Key tool for automated testing in this project, enabling cross-browser testing and automation of user flows.
   - **JUnit/TestNG**: Frameworks used for running Selenium tests and generating reports.
   - **TestNG Reports**: Capturing test results in detailed reports for analysis.
   - **CI/CD Integration**: Introduction to integrating Selenium tests into a Continuous Integration pipeline for automated testing in production environments.

### 5. **Defect Management**
   - **Defect Lifecycle**: Logging, tracking, and managing defects in the job portal application.
   - **Bug Reporting Tools**: Integration with tools like JIRA for effective tracking and management of bugs.
   - **Defect Resolution**: Ensuring that identified issues are addressed promptly in the development cycle.

### 6. **Performance and Load Testing**
   - **Stress Testing**: Simulating high traffic to verify how the job portal performs under load.
   - **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identifying and optimizing areas where the portal might experience performance degradation (e.g., slow search results).
